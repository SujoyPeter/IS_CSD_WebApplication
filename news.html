            Why earn an MBA? No matter your area of the working world, most aspects ultimately have business roots,
            creating a need for effective management, marketing, fiscal responsibility, and other core business
            practices. An MBA provides business professionals with the tools and knowledge necessary to understand and
            strategize more effectively to improve the overall health of their respective businesses.

            <br>
            Plus, adding an MBA to your credentials directly impacts your income potential. This is illustrated in the
            Graduate Management Admission Council’s Corporate Recruiter Survey 2023 Summary Report (Figure 16). The
            survey shows that people with an MBA earn 77% more than people with only a bachelor’s degree.
